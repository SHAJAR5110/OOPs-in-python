### Explanation of `self` and `class` in Python:

#### 1. **What is a Class?**

A class in Python is a blueprint for creating objects. Think of a class as a mold from which we can create many individual instances (objects). In this example, the `Student` class is the mold that defines what properties and behaviors a student should have.

#### 2. **What is an Object?**

An object is an instance of a class. Each object has its own data and methods. When you create an object from a class, you're essentially creating an individual student with a name and marks.

#### 3. **What is `self`?**

`self` is a special keyword in Python that refers to the current instance of the class. It is used to access the attributes and methods of the class.

When you write a method inside a class, `self` refers to the specific object that is calling that method. Each object has its own version of data, and `self` helps us access and modify that data.

#### Example Walkthrough:

Let's imagine you have a class called `Student`. This class has an initializer (`__init__`) method, which helps define the properties of the student, like their name and marks. The `self` parameter refers to the individual student object being created.

* When you create a student object, you pass a name and marks to the class.
* The `__init__` method will then store those values in the object's memory.

After this, you have a `display` method which will print out the student's name and marks. The `self` in this method is used to refer to the specific student whose details you want to display.

#### 4. **Why do we use `self`?**

* Without `self`, Python would not know which instance of the class you're referring to.
* Every time you create a new student, `self` ensures that each student has their own independent data, such as `name` and `marks`.
* `self` makes sure that methods in the class work with the correct data for each instance.

#### 5. **Step-by-Step Breakdown of How the Code Works:**

1. **Class Definition:** You define a class with an `__init__` method. This method will initialize the studentâ€™s name and marks.
2. **Creating an Object:** When you create a student like `student1 = Student('Shajar', 90)`, Python creates an object (or instance) of the class `Student` and assigns it the data passed ('Shajar' and 90).
3. **Using `self`:** Inside the `__init__` method, `self.name` and `self.marks` store the individual student's data. This means each student object can hold different data.
4. **Displaying Data:** When you call `student1.display()`, it prints the details of that specific student. Here `self` in the `display` method refers to `student1`, allowing it to display that student's name and marks.

#### 6. **Conclusion:**

* `self` ensures that each object has its own unique set of data, separate from other objects.
* The `class` provides a template, and `self` allows each individual object to store and access its own data.
