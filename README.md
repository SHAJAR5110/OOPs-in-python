# OOPs in Python

This repository demonstrates various Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Python through well-structured and beginner-friendly assignments. Each concept is explained using example code and brief explanations to help learners understand the fundamentals of OOP.

## Topics Covered

1. **Using `self`**
   Demonstrates how the `self` keyword is used to initialize instance variables within a class.

2. **Using `cls`**
   Illustrates the use of class methods and the `cls` keyword to access and modify class variables.

3. **Public Variables and Methods**
   Shows how public members of a class can be accessed from outside.

4. **Class Variables and Class Methods**
   Explains the use of class variables shared across instances and how to modify them using class methods.

5. **Static Variables and Static Methods**
   Introduces static methods that do not rely on instance or class data.

6. **Constructors and Destructors**
   Demonstrates how constructors (`__init__`) and destructors (`__del__`) work in Python classes.

7. **Access Modifiers: Public, Private, and Protected**
   Explains how to define and access variables with different access levels.

8. **The `super()` Function**
   Covers how to call a parent classâ€™s constructor or methods using `super()`.

9. **Abstract Classes and Methods**
   Uses the `abc` module to define abstract base classes and methods that must be implemented by subclasses.

10. **Instance Methods**
    Shows how to define and use methods that operate on instances of a class.

11. **Class Methods**
    Demonstrates how class methods work and how they differ from instance methods.

12. **Static Methods**
    Explains static methods with examples where class or instance data is not required.

13. **Composition**
    Demonstrates how one class can be composed of another, emphasizing "has-a" relationships.

14. **Aggregation**
    Shows how one class can reference another while allowing independent existence.

15. **Method Resolution Order (MRO) and Diamond Inheritance**
    Explains how Python resolves methods in multiple inheritance scenarios.

16. **Function Decorators**
    Demonstrates how to create and use function decorators to extend function behavior.

17. **Class Decorators**
    Introduces decorators that modify or extend class behavior.

18. **Property Decorators: `@property`, `@setter`, and `@deleter`**
    Teaches how to control access to instance variables using properties.

19. **`callable()` and `__call__()`**
    Shows how to make objects callable like functions.

20. **Creating a Custom Exception**
    Demonstrates how to define and raise user-defined exceptions.

21. **Make a Custom Class Iterable**
    Explains how to implement `__iter__()` and `__next__()` to create iterable objects.
